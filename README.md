# Vincent's website

<https://ghzmdr.github.com>

âœ‹! Welcome to the source code for my website, here's a brief description of what you're looking at.

> #### Disclaimer:
>
> This website is not your usualproduction-proof application nor it is intended to be.
Its build quality is often sacrificed in favor of flexibility and experimentation.
Definetly not what I would usually push to prod, but something fun, fresh and flexible.



#### Goals:

+ Build something that can be published in less than a week.
+ Have it look good and reflect my presonality.
+ Have a nexus to link together my online identities.
+ Offer a quick peek of what I like / am good at.
+ Offer a cohesive and playful experience.
+ Offer detailed infos about me.
+ Keep design and development fluid, fun and expressive.


#### Choiches:

+ No framework.
+ Prefer flexibility over stability (but mind performance!).
+ Design, build and improve (and delete, redo, throw away) with fast iterations.
+ Costrain myself into using a blank canvas with less tools possible and just go with the flow to maximise creativity.


#### Reasons:

+ Looser requirements, not your usual produciton application.
+ I needed something quick, simple and effective.
+ I wanted to spend most of the time in crafting playful components rather than writing business logic
+ I wanted to be able to go from prototype to final code without minding unecessary layers in the middle.

##### TODOs (like, definetly want them in!)

+ A location / weather / mood widget.
+ SoundCloud custom player (for proper preloading and playback control)
+ Spotify playlist showing my last played tracks
+ Preloader with animation
+ Split HTML in modules FFS...

##### Older versions
In the commit history there are older versions which were not using any branching model, from now on I'll be using `git flow` with proper relases.


##### Building and modifying
You can play around with this website by cloning this repo, then run:

+ `yarn install` (or `npm install` if you don't use `yarn`)
+ `npm run develop`
+ Navigate your browser to `localhost:3000`

#Vincent's website

<https://ghzmdr.github.com>

âœ‹! Welcome to the source code for my website, here's a brief description of what you're looking at.

> ####Disclaimer:
>
> This website does not have to be production-proof, is mainly for me to experiment, showcase fresh concepts and give an idea of what goes on in my mind.
> This means its build quality is often sacrificed in favor of flexibility and experimentation.
> Definetly not what I would usually push to prod, but fun to develop and think about.



####Goals:

+ Have a place where to link people looking for me.
+ Offer users a quick peek of what I like to do and am good at in an organic experience.
+ Offer more infos about me, if they've liked what they've seen/heard.
+ Keep design and development fluid, fun and expressive.


####Choiches:

+ No framework.
+ Prefer flexibility and fast iterations over stability.
+ Design, build and improve (and delete, redo, throw away) with fast iterations.


####Reasons:

+ I needed something quick, simple and effective.
+ I wanted to costrain myself into using a blank canvas with less tools possible and just go with the flow.
+ Unusual requirements, for example components don't need any lifecycle or events.
+ I wanted to be able to go from prototype to final code without minding unecessary layers in the middle.

___
##### TODOs (like, definetly want them in!)

+ A location / weather / mood widget.
+ SoundCloud custom player (for proper preloading and playback control)
+ Spotify playlist showing my last played tracks
+ Preloader with animation

____

#####Older versions
In the commit history there are older versions which were not using any branching model, from now on I'll be using `git flow` with proper relases.


#####Building and modifying
You can play around with this website by cloning this repo, then run:

+ `yarn install` (or `npm install` if you don't use `yarn`)
+ `npm run develop`
+ Navigate your browser to `localhost:3000`
